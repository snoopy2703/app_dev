## List of my Favorite Movies/Series
**Lalaland**
: This movie has great visual and aesthetic setting, the story is quite enganging and it is about two lovers who had separate dreams.

**Fallout**
: Fallout was a game that was made into a Tv series, the series was a new addition to the fallout world providing audience with pieces of answers that the game could never answered.

**Glee**
: Glee is one of my childhood favorites, It's a series about students in overcoming obstacles in their highschool life whilst aiming to become a champion in a singing contest.
